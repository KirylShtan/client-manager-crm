💼 About the Project

This project was created for a real law firm as an internal management tool.
It automates client case handling, stores client information, and simplifies the archiving process of completed cases.

Developed entirely from scratch — backend, frontend, architecture, and UI design. This is not the final version, so it would be growing.
Project also using XAMMP Apache + MySql but you can configure project without it.
